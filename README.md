# Shipping Kiosküöê

The self-use shipping kiosk software is a software that measures and takes package details as input, determines/dispenses necessary wrapping items, processes shipping details, delivers a shipping label, and processes payment. Its goals are to streamline the shipping process, create a safer shipping process in a post-COVID-19 world, and expand the software by deploying kiosks in popular public establishments: libraries, grocery stores, malls, and mail collection boxes.
